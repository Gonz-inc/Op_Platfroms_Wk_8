The documents in this project demonstrates my ability to work through the design of a software application and the communication to a client and any development team members.   

In this scenario, I as a student plays the role of a technology consultant who works for Creative Technology Solutions. The client The Gaming Room. What’s to expand their game application modeled after "Win, Lose or Draw" from the 1980s. The Gaming Room what’s to expand its game as a web-based game, and would like it to be accessible to multiple operating platforms.

What I did particularly well in this document was giving proper recommendations while taking feedback from previous revisions from my instructor. 

The process of working through a design document has helped me process how applications are structured. This helped me reference how to code the application based on all the information from the design document similar to how a builder would read blueprints.

If I were to revise a section of my design documentation, I would revise the development requirements. I would improve it by restructuring the table and also doing more research on the server side and client side. While also including other development tools that are available. 

How I interpreted the client’s needs was by thinking in their shoes and what they want from an application. In this case, they wanted a cross-platform game that can play on most operating systems. It’s important to consider the client’s needs because understanding the needs actually will help create a list of what kind idea of the application will ultimately be.

The approach I took when designing the software was to reference the design document and use it as a blueprint for the application. I also found that revising the design document as you go along will help improve the document. And in the future, I would use other techniques and strategies like lean development. This was in the future with a similar application the documentation and software development would be more efficient.
